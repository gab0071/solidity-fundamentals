<h2>Prettier definition </h2>
<p> Prettier offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What <Prettier> offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.</p>
